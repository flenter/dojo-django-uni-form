django-uni-form (django-uni-form)
=====================================

Django_ forms are easily rendered as tables,
paragraphs, and unordered lists. However, elegantly rendered div based forms
is something you have to do by hand. The purpose of this application is to
provide a simple tag and/or filter that lets you quickly render forms in a div
format.

NOTE:
* this is small branch of the django-uni-form project and uses dojo instead of jquery.

The how to install and use is the same as the original version except that it needs the dojo framework (well.. only dojo.js) and uni-form.dojo.js (instead of uni-form.jquery.js). 

To see how to install look at the django-uni-form project.
